### Hi there 👋
My name is Gog Oana, and I am a passionate second-year Computer Science student at the University Babeș-Bolyai. I have a deep love for technology and a keen interest in exploring the ever-evolving world of computer science.

#### 🌱 Learning and Growing
Continuous learning is at the core of my approach. I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my skill set. Whether it's experimenting with a new programming language, contributing to open-source projects, or attending tech meetups, I believe in staying curious and embracing the learning process.

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack
I enjoy the process of building projects from the ground up and collaborating with like-minded individuals to bring ideas to life.
